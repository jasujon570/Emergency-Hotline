<!-- Q-3: What is Event Bubbling and how does it work? -->
Ans to the question no-3:

Event bubbling means the event goes from the clicked element up to its parent, and then up to the whole webpage.
Think about bookshelf:
Click starts at the book (child element)
Then it "bubbles up" to the Shelf (parent element)
Then it "bubbles up" to the BookShelf (document)


<!-- Q-4: What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful? -->

Event delegation means putting the event on the parent instead of every child. It works because of event bubbling. Itâ€™s useful for performance and for handling dynamic elements.


<!-- Q-5: What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods? -->
