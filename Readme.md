Ans to the question no-1:

Searching or select element using id we will use getElementById.

Ans to the question no-2:

<!-- create element  -->
const newDiv = document.createElement("div");

Ans to the question no-3:

Event bubbling means the event goes from the clicked element up to its parent, and then up to the whole webpage.

<!-- Let's see how does it work with bookshelf analogy-->

Click starts at the book (child element)
Then it "bubbles up" to the Shelf (parent element)
Then it "bubbles up" to the BookShelf (document)


Ans to the question no-4:

Event delegation means putting the event on the parent instead of every child. It works because of event bubbling. Itâ€™s useful for performance and for handling dynamic elements.

preventDefault() stops the browser default action.
stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling to parents.
